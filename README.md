# HDLBits
My current progress through HDLBits (for fun)


I've excluded the simpler problems. Of course, the solutions are readily available on the internet but if you compare mine, you will find they are different and sometimes offer multiple approaches to acomplishing the desired result.

Eventually, I'll add solutions to problems from QuickSilicon to learn about RISC-V architecture and more.
